# WAV Analysis and Processing Tool

Welcome to the WAV Analysis and Processing Tool repository! This tool allows you to analyze WAV audio files and perform basic audio processing operations. You can extract various attributes from WAV file headers and even perform a simple Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on audio data.

## Features

- Extract attributes like file size, format type, channels, sample rate, and more from WAV headers.
- Perform FFT analysis on audio data.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/ShahMehraj/wav-file-utils.git`.
2. Make sure you have a `C` compiler installed.
3. Compile `main.c` along with `impeghd_fft_ifft_rom.c` using appropiate command for example, `gcc main.c impeghd_fft_ifft_rom.c`.
4. Run the compiled program.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to analyze WAV files and perform FFT.

## Usage

- Choose an option to extract attributes from the WAV file header.
- Select the FFT option to perform frequency domain analysis.
- The program guides you through the process interactively.
